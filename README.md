Predicting Student Failure and Dropout using the Open University Learning Analytics (OULA) dataset

The OULA dataset contains 7 separate csv files. The task is to merge them into one csv file before applying the CRISP-DM method to predict student failure and withdrawal. 

The OULA datset can be obtained here:  https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset
